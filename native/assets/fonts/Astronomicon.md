Hello everyone, I’m proud to announce the release of the **Astronomicon Fonts**.

I’ve been working on this side project for a while, and now they are ready and free to download. The spirit of this project is to contribute to the spiritual community out there, providing a set of astrological glyphs as complete as possible. The style is minimal, allowing the fonts to adapt and blend nicely regardless of the context.

**Download:**

## The Project

I had designed my version of the basic astrological symbols for quite some time and have been using my planets and zodiac signs glyphs on this website since. For more than a year I’ve also been using **Astrolog**, a free and open-source astrology software created by Walter Pullen.

Since I wanted to use my glyphs in Astrolog, I contacted Walter and proposed them. An exchange of ideas followed, and the set gradually expanded.

All objects supported by Astrolog were eventually added. This makes **Astronomicon Fonts one of the most complete astrology font sets available**.

Thanks to **Walter Pullen** for his support and careful review of details.
